# Bootstrap Sass & ESM JS

Include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)'s source Sass and an ES Module version of our JavaScript plugins thanks to [`guybedford/es-module-shims`](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims). Also includes the [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for cross-browser CSS, [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) for Sass code quality, and [Popper](https://popper.js.org), a peer dependency of Bootstrap's JS used to position dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips.
